**PROBLEM DEFINITION :**

Air pollution costs Indian businesses **$95 billion or 3% 
of Indiaâ€™s GDP** every year. 

These are: 

* The opportunity cost of lost worker productivity (e.g., due to higher absenteeism)
* Revenue decrease/lost due to reduced consumer footfall
* The opportunity cost of premature mortality attributed to air pollution

**VALUE ADDITION :**

* Suggest health impact threshold limits for twelve parameters for which short-term air quality standards are prescribed.
* Suggest qualitative description of air quality and associated likely health impacts for different AQI values.
* Evaluate AQI with data from a few major cities and towns.
* Analysis of available AQIs including international practices.

**Models prepared on:**

* OLS Model
* Stepwise Regression
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Regularization
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* AdaBoostRegressor
* Tuning with GridSearchCV
*Best model deployed with Pickle to reduce time complexity.

**CONCLUSION :**

* Delhi was found most polluted city for Vehicular Pollution whereas Ahmedabad for Industrial Emission.
* AQI for year before 2020 was high, but after 2020 there was significant drop. Probable reason is Covid.
* AQI is most affected by the pollutant PM2.5 and PM10.

* For Tuned Random Forest Regressor Model we do not see much underfitting or overfitting condition.
* Model is capable of predicting the test data with 89% accuracy.
* RMSE values are similar on train and test dataset, also is less when compared to other models.
